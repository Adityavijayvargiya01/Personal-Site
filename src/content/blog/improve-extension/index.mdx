Have you ever found yourself second-guessing your writing, especially when English isn't your first language? Or maybe you're a native speaker who still pauses before hitting "send" on that important tweet or email? I recently built a Chrome extension called "Improve" to solve exactly this problem.

## The Problem

As someone who writes online frequently whether on Twitter, Reddit, or blog posts. I constantly worry about grammar, sentence structure, and overall clarity. Ideas often get stuck in my head because I'm uncertain about how to express them properly. My usual workflow involved opening ChatGPT or Gemini in a separate tab, pasting my text, asking for improvements, then copying the result back. It was clunky and broke my writing flow.

When I saw how elegantly Notion AI integrated text improvement directly into their product, I knew I wanted to build something similar but accessible anywhere on the web.

## The Solution

"Improve" is a Chrome extension that brings AI-powered text enhancement right to your browser toolbar. Here's what makes it special:

### Multiple Writing Styles

The extension offers five distinct improvement modes:

- **Default**: General grammar and clarity improvements

- **Casual**: Friendly, conversational tone

- **Formal**: Professional, business-appropriate language

- **Concise**: Trim unnecessary words, focus on brevity

- **Elaborative**: Add detail and context for richer content

### Smart Inline Editing

Instead of just replacing your text, the extension shows exactly what changed using strikethrough formatting. For example: "She ~~go~~ goes to the ~~store~~ market." This transparency helps you learn from the improvements.

### Human-Like Output

One interesting challenge was making the AI output feel natural and human. Each prompt template includes specific instructions to avoid robotic patterns, use varied sentence structures, and include subtle imperfections that make the writing feel authentic.

## Real-World Impact

Since building this extension, my writing workflow has completely changed. Instead of context-switching to separate AI tools, I can quickly improve any text right from my browser. The inline editing format also helps me learn from the improvements, gradually making me a better writer.

For the past couple days, I've been using Improve to tweet, reply on Reddit, fill out online forms, and much more.

Improve began as a solution to a problem I encountered frequently, so I decided to make it. When I showed it to a couple of my friends and mentors, they gave me the confidence to convert it into a project.

## Demo

<video controls width="100%" style="border-radius: 8px; margin: 1rem 0;">
  <source src="/static/demo-video.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
  Your browser does not support the video tag.

Sometimes the best solutions come from scratching your own itch and in this case, that itch was worrying about every sentence I write online.

This entire blog post was improved using the very extension described within it.
