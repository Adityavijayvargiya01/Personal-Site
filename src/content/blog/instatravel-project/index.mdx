## Introduction

InstaTravel is a travel website that curates accommodations based on recommendations from Instagram influencers. The goal is to provide users with personalized travel recommendations inspired by popular Instagram posts , influencers can list the hotels and resorts themselves based on their on experience. 

## Idea behind Instatravel

InstaTravel revolves around curated listings of remarkable accommodations that have been hand-picked and recommended by popular Instagram influencers. The platform combines these influencer recommendations with reviews/ratings from actual guests to provide validation.

Users get personalized accommodation suggestions based on the influencers they follow, their preferences, and travel details. The more you engage with InstaTravel, the better its recommendations become.

In addition to curating influencer-recommended listings, InstaTravel incentivizes influencers to promote destinations through sponsored Instagram ads.
